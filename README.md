K-Means Clustering for Accommodation Selection: Revision Notes
Project Overview
Objective: Help students find suitable accommodations in Bangalore (or other cities) based on:
Amenities (Wi-Fi, laundry, meals, etc.)
Budget (low, medium, high)
Proximity to colleges and key locations.
Methodology: Use K-Means Clustering to classify accommodations and present the results visually.
Real-World Relevance:
Saves time for students.
Assists businesses (e.g., real estate developers, restaurant chains) in optimizing decisions.
High-Level Approach
Data Collection:
Collected accommodation details:
Latitude, longitude.
Amenities and budget.
Proximity to colleges and landmarks.
Used Foursquare API for geolocational data:
Nearby venues (cafes, restaurants, shops, etc.).
Data Cleaning:
Handled Missing Values:
Imputed missing coordinates.
Standardized Formats:
Normalized budget ranges and amenity categories.
Removed duplicates using Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Boxplots: Detected rent and proximity outliers.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed relationships (e.g., budget vs. proximity).
Visualized trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Clustering with K-Means:
Used Scikit-Learn for clustering.
Normalization:
Standardized budget, proximity, and amenities to ensure balanced weighting.
Elbow Method:
Determined the optimal number of clusters.
Output:
Groups of accommodations with similar characteristics.
Visualization:
Folium:
Mapped clusters with unique colors.
Displayed nearby venues for each accommodation.
Interactive maps allowed detailed exploration.
Cluster Characteristics
Cluster A: Budget-Friendly Options

Rent: ₹5,000–₹10,000/month.
Amenities: Basic (Wi-Fi, laundry).
Location: Farther from colleges and transport hubs.
Target Audience: Cost-sensitive students.
Cluster B: Premium Accommodations

Rent: ₹20,000+ per month.
Amenities: Fully furnished, air conditioning, meal plans.
Location: Near restaurants, malls, and recreation centers.
Target Audience: Students with higher budgets.
Cluster C: Balanced Options

Rent: ₹10,000–₹15,000/month.
Amenities: Essential amenities, moderate proximity.
Location: Near some cafes and fast-food outlets.
Target Audience: Students seeking balance.
Cluster D: Isolated but Affordable

Rent: Under ₹5,000/month.
Amenities: Minimal, basic facilities.
Location: Far from key areas.
Target Audience: Students prioritizing cost over convenience.
Patterns Identified
Proximity vs. Budget:
Closer accommodations have higher rents.
Peripheral areas offer cheaper options.
Amenities Distribution:
High-budget clusters provide more amenities.
Venue Density:
Areas with more cafes and restaurants align with premium accommodations.
Applications
For Students:
Quick identification of accommodations based on preferences.
Social lifestyle clusters highlighted for recreation-seeking students.
For Businesses:
Real estate: Identify gaps in accommodation types (e.g., lack of mid-range options).
Restaurants: Focus on high-demand clusters for outlet expansion.
Tools and Libraries
Libraries:
Pandas: Data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization.
Scikit-Learn: K-Means Clustering.
Folium: Map visualization.
API:
Foursquare API: Venue and geolocational data.
Challenges and Solutions

Presenting findings effectively to non-technical stakeholders.
Expected Questions
Why K-Means Clustering?
Simple, efficient unsupervised algorithm for grouping data points.
Suitable for datasets with clearly separable characteristics.
How did you decide the number of clusters?
Used the Elbow Method by plotting the inertia (sum of squared distances) for different cluster counts.
Selected the point where the rate of reduction slowed (elbow point).
What challenges did you face with geolocational data?
Missing coordinates, resolved using approximate data or APIs.
Addressed bias from unequal density of venues in different areas.
How did you ensure feature importance was balanced?
Normalized features (budget, proximity, amenities) to give equal weight.
How is this project useful for businesses?
Real estate: Identifies profitable locations for development.
Restaurants: Maps customer density to optimize outlet placement.
Why use Folium for visualization?
Interactive maps provide a clear and intuitive representation of clusters.
Enables users to explore data visually.
Conclusion
The project showcases the ability to:
Handle real-world datasets.
Implement machine learning (K-Means).
Integrate APIs for enhanced functionality.
Visualize data effectively for decision-making.
It combines technical, analytical, and communication skills, making it an ideal project for a data science professional.
